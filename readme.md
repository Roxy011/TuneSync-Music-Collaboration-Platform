Project: Simple Music Cloud Community System using PHP/MySQLi

About The Project

The Simple Music Cloud Community System is a simple project that is inspired by the Spotify Web Application. This system requires system credentials to access all of the data and functionalities of the music cloud community system. The system has 2 types of users which is the Administrator and the Subscriber. The Admin user can manage all the functionalities of the system including the music uploaded, and playlist of the subscriber user while the Subscriber user can only manage the songs they uploaded and playlist they created but since this also like and music publishing site, the system allows all users to listen all uploaded music or songs and also listen to the playlist songs created by other subscribers and admin. The Subscriber user can also download any song that can be accessed in this system.

How the System Works
The Simple Music Cloud Community System has a registration form on the Login Page by clicking the "Create New Account". After creating a new account, the system will automatically login to the new subscriber using his/her created credentials. On the "Home Page", the summary numbers of all Genres, Playlist, Songs, Subscriber, Subscriber's Uploaded Songs, and Subscriber's Created Playlist. The Genre page can only be managed by the Admin users which makes the subscribers read the Genre's Details and listen to songs uploaded filtered into the viewed or selected genre. The Playlist Page is the page where the user view, create and manage the playlist. The system navigates to each page without refreshing the window so the music doesn't stop when redirecting other pages.
